<p>For close to two millennia, Jews have been saying Kaddish for their loved ones.  Some people say that it's the prayer for the dead, but actually, it's the prayer for the living. In fact, there is no mention of death in the Kaddish.  Saying Kaddish is the Jewish way for the living to honor their family members who have passed away. </p>
<p>Traditionally, the sons of the deceased say Kaddish during the year following the death and on every yahrzeit  (anniversary of the death).  However, if this is not possible, then according to our Sages, it is permissible for someone else to say Kaddish.</p>
<p>Kaddish in Israel recites Kaddish for your loved one at each of the three daily prayer services throughout the year after death and on the yahrzeit .  In addition, Kaddish on the yahrzeit can be said at the Kotel (Western Wall) in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Furthermore, whenever Kaddish in Israel is requested to say Kaddish, a donation is made to the Lone Soldier Fund in Israel.  Lone soldiers are the brave young men and women who volunteer to fight in the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) despite having no family support in Israel.  Many of these soldiers hail from the US and Canada.</p>
